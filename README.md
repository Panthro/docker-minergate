# minergate-cli for docker

As if there weren't enough!

## Why is this one different?

Automated builds!!

## Usage

eg:

```bash
docker run --name some-minergate panthro/docker-minergate -user my.user@domain.com -xmr
```

Make sure you review the options in [MinerGate](https://minergate.com/) just in case they update anything and the above command stops working
